/*
The following is the exact list of additions to JSON’s syntax introduced by JSON5. All of these are optional, and all of these come from ES5.

Objects:
* Object keys can be unquoted if they’re valid identifiers. Yes, even reserved keywords (like default) are valid unquoted keys in ES5 [§11.1.5, §7.6]. (More info)
  (TODO: Unicode characters and escape sequences aren’t yet supported in this implementation.)
* Object keys can also be single-quoted.
* Objects can have trailing commas.

Arrays:
* Arrays can have trailing commas.

Strings:
* Strings can be single-quoted.
* Strings can be split across multiple lines; just prefix each newline with a backslash. [ES5 §7.8.4]

Numbers:
* Numbers can be hexadecimal (base 16).
* Numbers can begin or end with a (leading or trailing) decimal point.
* Numbers can include Infinity, -Infinity, NaN, and -NaN.
* Numbers can begin with an explicit plus sign.

Comments:
* Both inline (single-line) and block (multi-line) comments are allowed.
